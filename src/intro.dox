/*! @page Introduction


Libprob is a discrete probability distribution library for C++11 based on Eigen. The library uses variadic 
templates to encapsulate the matrix storage of multivariate probability distributions. Additional support for 
basic algebraic operations like joining, marginalization or Bayes' rules is provided, as well as information 
theoretic measures like entropy and mutual information.
